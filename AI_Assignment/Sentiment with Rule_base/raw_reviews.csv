5.0 out of 5 starsReview of the demo from product support team,5.0,Ramnarayanan G,Reviewed in India on 4 January 2026,"We purchased this vacuum robot a few days back, as soon as the delivery was completed we were contacted by ILIFE team to schedule the demo, we had to postpone the demo a couple of times, they accomodated our request for a Sunday. The demo was given by Mr.SUMITH over Google Meet, he did an excellent job in going through all the features of the robot and the app, even though the map creation took longer than expected he was online in the call to explain the menus which could be used only with a map. Overall we are very satisfied with this initial interaction with ILIFE team, I will update this review after using the robot for some time."
