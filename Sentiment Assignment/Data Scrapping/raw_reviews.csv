4.0 out of 5 starsGreat product but with some cons especially for Indians.,4.0,Raj Vartak,Reviewed in India on 8 May 2025,Pros : Product has good quality and functionality wise. The build attachment and overall unit feels premium. Most of the attachments are useful in day to day cleaning. Suction power is great. The unit is not much compact or lightweight since it is not a handheld vaccum cleaner but still won't call it bulky. Cons : Giving it 4 stars instead of 5 due to 2 reasons. The main issue is the plug of cleaner is 16A which is larger than standard household 3 pin sockets in india. This Should have been highlighted by the seller somewhere easily visible instead of keeping it in the last line of product summary since they are selling in India. Second the noise the cleaner makes is considerably loud. You cannot use it early mornings or late nights and expect no complaint from neighbour :) .. Overall product is good. Go for it as long as u get it in reasonable price and keep in mind u will need a power socket adapter in India in order to connect it in standard power outlet. Read more
